# Mundane Tasks CLI Handbook

Handbook for doing mundane tasks with CLI tools.

## What is this?

As a software developer, I find myself often need to do some of these tasks: convert an EPOCH timestamp to a formatted date, inspect a JSON Web Token, convert back-and-forth Base64 encoded string, encoding URLs, etc.

Usually, I would reach out to some of the online services for these tasks, but I realized that it would be better if I could do them from the terminal via CLI tools. By doing this, it saves me time and it is more secure (pasting some JWT onto an online service emposes a security risk).

This is just a personal handbook (reads "cheatsheet") as a reference for all those tasks.
